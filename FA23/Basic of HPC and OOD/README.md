# Basic of HPC and OOD (09/07/2023)


### Outline

* What is HPC?

* How to access HPC?

* How to transfer data?

* What is OOD?


### What is HPC?

* High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster is a collection of networked computers and data storage.
* HPC are modern day supercompters (rack-mounted computers, Networking, Storage)

* Access via the login nodes.
* Shared filesystem presents data across all nodes.
* Submit jobs scheduled to run on compute nodes.


### Why use HPC?
*  Donâ€™t want to tie up your own machine 
*  Have many long running jobs to run
*  Want to run in parallel to get results quicker 
*  Need more disk space 
*  Need more memory
*  Want to use software installed on the cluster
*  Want to access data stored on the cluster 
*  Want to use GPUs
