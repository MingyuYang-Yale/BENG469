## Log on to the Clusters

You should have received a email from Yale Center for Research Computing:

Yale's clusters can only be accessed on the Yale network. Therefore, in order to access a cluster from off campus, you will need to first connect to Yale's VPN. 

Use SSH with SSH key pairs to log in to the clusters. 

SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a set of two pieces of information that you use to identify yourself and encrypt communication to and from a server. Usually this takes the form of two files: a public key (often saved as id_rsa.pub) and a private key (id_rsa or id_rsa.ppk). To use an analogy, your public key is like a lock and your private key is what unlocks it. It is ok for others to see the lock (public key), but anyone who knows the private key can open your lock (and impersonate you)
